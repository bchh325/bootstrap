      <p><b>Unity</b> <br>
      One of the main things that I recently got into is Unity 3D.
      As one of the more popular game engines to start with, it uses C#.
        In my eyes, it seems similar to Java with the semi-colons and how the
        blocks are structured.

      <p><b>Video Games</b> <br>
      Obviously, my drive towards learning Unity (and possibly other game engines in the future),
      comes from playing games myself. I have always played games growing up simply because it
      is one of the most revolutionary forms of entertainment. The immersion that one gets from being
      able to be put in a fictional world where anything goes lets our imaginations run wild,
      and I want to be able to create that new reality.

      <p><b>Cardistry</b> <br>
      Cardistry is something that I picked up during my freshman year of high school.
      It is essentially comprised of card flourishes aimed at making cards look as cool
      as possible. One of the most famous flourishes is the card spring, where the deck of cards
      is sprung from one hand to another. I am not too good at it, as I have not been practicing it as
      much as I have been before.

      <h2>What Computer Sciences Means to Me</h2>
      <h5>Chhorb, Bryan <small><i>May 7, 2021</i></small></h5>
      <p>Computer Science Major</p>
      <p>Like all majors and studies, everyone is entitled pursue what they like best. For me, Computer Science
        if one of the most interesting and engaging majors. It allows ideas to be created out of thin air, almost like painting
        but instead of a brush and a blank canvas board, it is a keyboard and a computer screen. Not only that, but the problems
        that arise from attempting to create your idea is almost like a little jigsaw puzzle, one that is not there to stop you—but to enhance—
        the knowledge that you already have. It is almost like a million different mini games that you have to play to complete your project.
        <br>
        <br>
        In a world where technology is growing at a rate faster than ever before, being able to be apart of Computer Science means
        being able to use that technology in its purest form to manipulate and create anything you want, either for you to enjoy
        or for others to enjoy too. It means being able to help you with booking your vacation to the Bahamas, creating a
        virtual reality for you to have fun it, and assisting you in finding your ideal and fun career.
